Crystal Bot is a meme-bot designed to ~~annoy~~ interact with server members in the most funny yet unintrusive way possible.<br />
It's also a bot built to be extensible, with methods to easily add events and commands my simply dropping in the new files.<br />
The main point of this bot was to get practice with JavaScript, but also to build something fun for the members of our [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/c58f4Rsx7n)

## Features
__ALL__ of these features are currently WIP, as this bot is largely just a skeleton. However, we plan on implementing some goofy features, here's a list of some of them!

- Randomly pop into VC channels when members are connected, mute everyone, play a random audio file, then unmute them again and leave
- Every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday at 1:34 PM, 5:12 AM, and 4:56 PM (CST) the bot says a random fact about desks and chairs
- When the word "YouTube" is mentioned, the bot replies with crazy messages
- Every Tuesday the bot mentions itself saying "I am found you ip adress and am currently hacking you are xbox account". A minute later the bot mentions itself again saying "You doesnt hack me, my dad is microsoft"
- The bot says "Gosh darn it! I forgot my (random thing that wouldnt normally be in a microwave) in the microwave again!" every friday at 8:26 AM CST
- "Crystal bot fan" role for people who interact most with the bot
    - Users with the "Crystal bot fan" role can use special commands
- Every few days the bot does a poll asking users to pick their favorite thing out of a list of completely random, unrelated options
- At a random time every 2 weeks, the bot random sends a video "proving" Gordon Ramsey is actually making thousands of clones of himself on the moon, and the bot will warn your server, saying that if nothing is done to stop him now, in about 5 years 1 in 3 people will be Gordon Ramsey
- The bot will randomly DM people if it catches them playing Roblox
